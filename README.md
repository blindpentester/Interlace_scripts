# Interlace_scripts
This is a location where I wanted to share my Interlace scripts/examples for large/small size campaigns or fun automation for various other things I could think of.

### Structure for scripts
    _block:name_ - Commands between the "blocks" will run in sequential order from top to bottom.
    _blocker_ - This tells the script to stop processing other commands until the ones above are completed
    Bash Scripting - Interlace does not take bash scripting commands, so it is important to have  
                     your script.sh ready to be called to within a block if you wish it to be used.
